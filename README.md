# Social-Network-Project
I have developed for 4-5 months a complex social network in Java! This project was made in a team of two people.
This is an application that allows users to register, log in, send friend requests, accept,decline or cancel them, 
send messages to other users in private chats or in usermade group chats.<br />

We made a chat that works almost the same as the ones on Facebook,Instagram.You can send messages and reply to some messages.
Also, if you open more instances for this app ,the changes that one user made in the private/group chat will be visible in all other instances as well.<br />

Also,the app allows to create events and notify users when that events approch the start date. You can make reports in this app about user activity and all messages
in which the user was involved. You can create PDF reports that can be saved on local machine.<br />
